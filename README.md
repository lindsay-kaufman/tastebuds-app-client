# TasteBuds

This application allows a user to add restaurants to a favorites list as well as make comments on them. I wanted to create this application so that users could share their favorite places with their friends.

## Planning Story
In planning this application, I first created my ERD's, wrote detailed user stories and created wireframes for a logged in and logged out user. Then, I created a schedule to follow as well as a checklist of project requirements.

## User Stories
- As a user, I would like to have the ability to sign in and out.
- As a user, I would like to have the ability to change my password.
- As a user, I would like to be notified if my sign in or change password fails.
- As a user, I would like to favorite a restaurant.
- As a user, I would like to remove a restaurant from my favorites.
- As a user, I would like to view all my restaurants.
- As a user, I would like to add a comment to my favorite restaurants.

## Technologies Used
- Ruby on Rails
- Javascript
- jQuery
- Ajax
- HTML/CSS
- Handlebars
- Bootstrap

## Unsolved Problems
- Eventually I would like to implement Google Maps API to allow users to favorite their locations on a map.
- I would also like to give users the ability to follow each other and view each others favorites.
